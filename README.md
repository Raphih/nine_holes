# nine_holes

VERY rough code for implementing the Nine Holes boardgame and an AI based on the 
minimax algorithm to play it.

Start the game by running pvsai_nineholes. The order of players will be assigned
randomly. 

Upcoming updates will probably make playing the game more user-friendly and hopefully 
make the code more readable.
